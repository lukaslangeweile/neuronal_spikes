# Neuronal Spike Detection Project

This project aims to develop a Python script to detect neuronal spikes in a series of previously recorded electrical signals. The goal is to create an efficient, modular, and accurate pipeline for analyzing these signals.

## Project Structure

- `functions.py`: Contains all helper functions for the project, such as data loading, preprocessing, and spike detection.
- `main.py`: Orchestrates the execution of the pipeline by calling the necessary functions from `functions.py`.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Tools to filter and normalize electrical signal data.
- **Spike Detection**: Algorithms to identify and classify neuronal spikes.
- **Integration Testing**: Automated tests to ensure the pipeline works as expected.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later

git pull origin main
Workflow for Contributions
1. Create a Branch
Create a new branch for your work:

bash
Code kopieren
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
Use a meaningful branch name, like feature/preprocessing or fix/spike-detection.

2. Write Code
Write clear, modular code.
Test your changes locally before committing.
3. Commit Your Changes
Commit frequently with descriptive messages:

git commit -m "feat: added preprocessing function"
4. Push Your Changes
Push your branch to the remote repository:


git push origin feature/your-feature-name
5. Open a Pull Request (PR)
Go to the GitHub repository and open a PR targeting the main branch.
In the PR:
